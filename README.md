# Keypoints detection models for bee and ramp detection
YOLOv8-pose models to detect:
1) bee's head and stinger using two keypoints.
2) corners of entrance ramp using 4 keypoints.

To train the models we used the _pose_ and _ramp_detection_ datasets from our repository https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gb9r2yhfc/6

Here, we share the trained nano-size models. The medium, and large-size models for keypoints detection of the bee and the ramp are available on:
